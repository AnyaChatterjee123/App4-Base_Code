Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The purpose of this diagnostic app is to determine a user's probablity of having schizophrenia and bipolar disorder based on his or her responses to questions pertaining to specific symptoms of both mental illnesses.
 
Known Issues:
The misdiagnnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is prevelant, so this diagnostic app differentiates the symptoms of both these mental illnesses and calculates the user's liklihood of having schiophrenia and bipolar disorder.
However, the app only includes four questions related to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder symptoms, so it calculates an imprecise schizophrenia percentage and bipolar disorder percentage based on the user's responses. Thus, the app should include more symptom questions to produce probabilities with greater accuracy of the user having schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

	<p>Many people with deteriorating mental health want to find out what specific mental illness they have in order to be aware of the most appropriate and effective treatments. Bipolar disorder is commonly seen as schizophrenia and vice versa by many, and the misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia occurs frequently. The symptoms of these two mental illnesses are distinct, so answer a few short questions to find out which one you may have.</p>
